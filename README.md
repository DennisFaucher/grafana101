# My Initial Journey with Grafana, <br> InfluxDB, Prometheus, VMware, Linux, Chickens

# Why

Well, two reasons actually:
1. As a vExpert, I have been digging into VMware's monitoring tools such as vRealize Operations and vRealize Log Insight. Wonderful tools and relatively easy to use. Some of my peer vExperts, especially [Jorge de la Cruz](https://jorgedelacruz.uk/), use Grafana to monitor VMware as well as other infrastructure and I wanted to compare the tools.
2. One of my primary customers at work, is looking to get more out of their use of Grafana as a single dashboard tool

# How

## Installing the core software
The "Starter Kit" for Grafana dashboards requires the installation of Grafana, Telegraf, and InfluxDB. Telegraf sends metrics to the Telegraf time series database and Grafana displays the InfluxDB (and other) data as beautiful graphs.
