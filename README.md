# My Initial Journey with Grafana, <br> InfluxDB, Prometheus, VMware, Linux, Chickens
![Grafana Dashboard](https://github.com/DennisFaucher/grafana101/blob/main/images/Grafana%20Main%20-%20Dodge.jpg)

# Why

Well, two reasons actually:
1. As a vExpert, I have been digging into VMware's monitoring tools such as vRealize Operations and vRealize Log Insight. Wonderful tools and relatively easy to use. Some of my peer vExperts, especially [Jorge de la Cruz](https://jorgedelacruz.uk/), use Grafana to monitor VMware as well as other infrastructure and I wanted to compare the tools.
2. One of my primary customers at work, is looking to get more out of their use of Grafana as a single dashboard tool

# How

## Installing the core software
The "Starter Kit" for Grafana dashboards requires the installation of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/), [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/), and [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). Telegraf sends metrics to the InfluxDB time series database and Grafana displays the InfluxDB (and other) data as beautiful graphs.
